# Planner
Planners influence the collaboration and execution strategies of actual agents. As we mentioned earlier, agentUniverse can be viewed as a Pattern Factory, and Planners are the practical carriers of the collaboration and execution philosophies of these patterns. Planners can encompass various types, such as making the agent adhere to a fully human-orchestrated workflow, follow a specific Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), or use certain specific models of operation like PEER/Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), or even allow the agent to work completely autonomously (Auto).
